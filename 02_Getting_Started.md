## Getting Started

0. Register an API client from your [Account Settings](https://layervault.com/settings) under the Applications menu.
0. For the Redirect URI, use ```urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob``` for now. Later on, if you were building a Web application for an API client, you would specify your post-user authorization redirect URL here.
0. Note your ```client_id``` and ```client_secret```.
0. Try the example Access Token request below.
